mapping glacier changes over time
===================================

description
-------------

On a global scale, glacier melt and recession is currently accelerating. Unfortunately, many studies of glacier changes
are constrained to the "satellite era" (ca. 1970-present), and observations of extent or length for many glaciers around
the world are only available at a single point in time. In this project, you will work to help fill in some of these
gaps by mapping glaciers using a combination of satellite imagery, declassified reconnaissance imagery, aerial
photographs, or even geomorphological imprints left by retreating glaciers. The focus is mostly open-ended, and could
vary from mapping glacier changes on a regional scale over several decades or even centuries, to mapping
higher-resolution changes at a single glacier. There is also the potential to analyze/compare glacier changes with
external factors such as air and ocean temperatures.

Potential study areas include Greenland, Arctic Canada, Alaska, the Russian Arctic, South America, or High Mountain
Asia. This project is suitable for a student with interest in satellite remote sensing/GIS, glaciology, geomorphology,
or even some computer programming (Python/Matlab or similar).
