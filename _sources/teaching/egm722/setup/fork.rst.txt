forking the repository
========================

Head to https://github.com/iamdonovan/egm722, which is the remote repository location for the materials for this module. 
If you are not currently logged in, do so now. Click the Fork button in the upper right-hand corner of the window:

.. image:: ../../../img/egm722/setup/fork/fork.png
    :width: 720
    :align: center
    :alt: the "fork" button for a github repository

|br| This will create a fork of the repository â€“ it will copy the entire repository over to your account. After a
minute, you should see the following:

.. image:: ../../../img/egm722/setup/fork/forked.png
    :width: 720
    :align: center
    :alt: the newly forked repository

|br| Congratulations! You have created your first fork! Make a note of the repository URL (for the example above,
it is https://github.com/bobtheburner/egm722).
