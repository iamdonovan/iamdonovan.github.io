statistical tests using spss
=============================

The purpose of this practical is to continue introducing you to SPSS, and complement the theoretical material presented
in the lectures, discussions, and reading material. The experience gained in analyzing and presenting data should also
help you continue to develop your confidence in using, presenting, and discussing numerical results.

In this practical, we will see how we can use SPSS for testing hypotheses. We will gain practice formulating the null
and alternative hypotheses, and in selecting appropriate statistical tests.
