This module serves as an introduction to GIS and remote sensing, both marine and terrestrial. The materials included here cover terrestrial remote sensing, which is Weeks 9-12 of the module.
The topics covered include:

- fundamentals of (terrestrial) remote sensing (electromagnetic radiation, atmosphere/surface interaction, spectral properties)
- satellites and sensors (orbits, active and passive sensors, where to find satellite data, digital imagery)
- images and classification (band combinations, image enhancement, classification, accuracy assessment)
- applications of (terrestrial) remote sensing (change detection, water resources, surface motion, archaeology)
