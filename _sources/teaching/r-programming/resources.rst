On this page, you will find links to additional resources/materials relevant to the material covered in the workshop.

**R** resources
----------------

- `R for Data Science <https://r4ds.hadley.nz/>`__ (2e): A free online version of an excellent book providing an
  introduction to **R** and data science.
- `A Crash Course in the R Programming Language <https://billpetti.github.io/Crash_course_in_R/>`__: A fairly comprehensive
  crash course/guide for the basics of **R**.
- `Programming with R <https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/index.html>`__: An online course introducing
  **R**.
- `Statology R Guides <https://www.statology.org/r-guides/>`__: A good resource for learning statistics that also has
  a number of guides for how to do various things in **R**.

git resources
--------------

- `Git Handbook <https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/>`__: A good, short introduction to git - what it
  is and why it's worth using.
- `Understand the GitHub flow <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/>`__: A short explainer on the basic workflow
  for git - how to use branches to more easily keep track of your projects.
- `GitHub Training & Guides <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7RrmoueENv9TZts3HXXtw>`__: YouTube channel for GitHub
  Training & Guides, which has a number of short-ish videos to help you get started with git and GitHub.
- `Learn Git Branching <https://learngitbranching.js.org/>`__: A great interactive tutorial that will help you get some
  practical experience with different git commands.
- `Github without the command line <https://coderefinery.github.io/github-without-command-line/>`__: CodeRefinery is a
  project within the `Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration <https://neic.no/>`__ that provides training courses and
  workshops in scientific programming and computing. This course provides a good introduction to using GitHub (and git)
  without the command line tools.
- `Oh My Git! <https://ohmygit.org/>`__: An open source game about learning git - similar to learn git branching above,
  but presented in a gameified format to help you learn + understand the commands and concepts surrounding git.

other resources

- `Software Carpentry <https://software-carpentry.org/>`__: An organization dedicated to teaching researchers computing
  skills needed for research. They have lots of good, free online resources, including a course in **R** linked above.
- `Data Carpentry <https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/>`__: An organization dedicated to teaching workshops that provide
  the fundamental data skills needed for research.
- `Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/>`__: The go-to resource for finding solutions to issues related to
  programming. If you have a question/issue, there's a good chance that someone else has already asked it, and gotten
  an answer. If not, you can post your question (be sure to check the posting guidelines!) to find help.
