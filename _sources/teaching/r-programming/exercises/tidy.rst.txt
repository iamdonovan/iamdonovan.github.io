keeping data tidy
==================

.. note::

    This is a **non-interactive** version of the exercise. If you want to run through the steps yourself and see the
    outputs, you'll need to follow the setup steps and work through the notebook on your own computer.

why?

- vectorization
- saves space (can drop NA values)

- lengthening data
- widening data
