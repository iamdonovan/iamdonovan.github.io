setup
======

To get started with the exercises, you'll need to install **git**, **conda**, and **Rstudio** on your computer.

You will also need a **GitHub** account, and you'll need to fork and clone the
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/iamdonovan/intro-to-r>`__ for the workshop.

Finally, you'll need to set up a **conda** environment so that you can install the packages that we will use
for the exercises.

Each of the links below will take you through the different steps - I recommend starting at the top
and working your way to the bottom in order.
