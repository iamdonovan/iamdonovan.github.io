research (and research interests)
---------------------------------

Remote sensing is an incredible tool that can be used to study the natural world, from landscape changes on enormous
scales to estimating populations of different animals, including polar bears, penguin colonies, and seals. My main
research interest is in using satellite data to study natural phenomena on different spatial and temporal scales, from
individual glacier fjords in Alaska to all of the world's glaciers over a 50+ year time span. My main research focus
has been on glacier change, and how glaciers impact not only the physical world, but terrestrial and marine ecosystems.
At present, I am working on projects to study glacier changes in Alaska since the Little Ice Age, re-processing historic
aerial and satellite images to study landscape and glacier changes, and mapping glaciers and landscape features using
tools such as Google Earth Engine.

In short: I do some research stuff. Sometimes it's pretty neat.
