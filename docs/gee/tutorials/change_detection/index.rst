change detection
=================

So far, we've been looking at how we can extract information from single images - that is, a snapshot of what an area
looks like at a single point in time. One of the most powerful applications of remote sensing, however, is the ability
to view large-scale changes over time - that is, to detect changes.

In this section, we'll look at a few different examples of change detection - starting from visually
inspecting the differences between images, to making multitemporal composites, to looking at entire time series of
values over time.
