===============================

In this section, we'll learn about the fundamentals of remote sensing, starting with the basics of electromagnetic
radiation, how it interacts with the earth's atmosphere and objects on the earth's surface, and finally how we can use
electromagnetic radiation to identify objects using their spectral properties.
