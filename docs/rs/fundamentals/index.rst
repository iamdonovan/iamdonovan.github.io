fundamentals of remote sensing
===============================

Now that we've established the "what" part of remote sensing, we can start to look into the "how". Specifically, we'll
start with the basics of electromagnetic radiation: what it is, how it interacts with the atmosphere, and how it
interacts with the Earth's surface and the different objects that we would like to study. We'll also start to see how
we can use electromagnetic radiation to identify objects using their spectral properties.
