teaching
===========

In the past, I have taught modules on glaciology, remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), physical
geography, and programming. At Ulster University, I teach remote sensing, physical geography, and programming modules
for the BSc Hons Geography and Environmental Science degrees, as well as for the PgDip/MSc courses in GIS, and Remote
Sensing and GIS. I also supervise PhD Researchers, MSc, and BSc research projects in a variety of subjects.

In the menu on the left, you can see links to materials for the modules that Iâ€™ve developed at Ulster as part of both
the Remote Sensing and GIS and GIS MSc courses. Eventually, I will also include some of my past lectures/presentations.
If you are a student and they are at all helpful or interesting to you, please feel free to go through them. If you are
working on delivering/developing your own modules, please feel free to use and adapt them.
