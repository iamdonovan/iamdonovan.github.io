mapping harmful algal blooms using satellite remote sensing
==============================================================

description
-------------

Harmful algal blooms affect public health and ecosystem integrity, and are increasing in frequency and intensity due to
effects associated with pollution and climate change. The growth of available satellite data in recent years provides
an effective tool for detecting and monitoring these events. Methods used to detect harmful algal blooms from satellite
imagery range from relatively simple indices to more complex machine learning approaches. For this project, you will
investigate the use of optical satellite imagery to detect harmful algal blooms, with the potential for investigating
both inland water bodies or coastal areas.

Suitable for a student with interest in satellite remote sensing and water quality monitoring.
