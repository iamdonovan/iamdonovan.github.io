urban heat islands
======================

description
-------------

Urban or built environments tend to be hotter than surrounding natural or rural areas, though even within urban areas
there can be considerable variation in temperature. This effect, known as the “urban heat island” effect, is due to the
physical properties of the built environment, which tends to absorb solar energy and trap heat. Urban heat islands can
have a direct impact on the health and welfare of residents, and the effects are often worse in poorer areas of a city.
In this project, you will use a combination of satellite remote sensing and GIS to investigate aspects of urban heat
islands in a study area to be determined. Suitable for a student with an interest in remote sensing/GIS, social policy,
or sustainable development.
