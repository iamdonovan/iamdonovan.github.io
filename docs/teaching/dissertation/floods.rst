flood detection and monitoring using remote sensing
=====================================================

description
-------------

Floods can inundate large areas, causing damage to agricultural lands, property, transportation links, and leading to
loss of life. Satellite remote sensing, especially Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), is a key tool for identifying and
mapping flood-prone areas, helping to improve flood management and mitigate these damaging effects. In this project,
you will investigate the use of GIS and remote sensing to identify flood-prone areas in a study region to be determined.

Suitable for a student with an interest in remote sensing/GIS, land use management, or hazard and risk management.
