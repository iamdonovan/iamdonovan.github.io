undergraduate dissertation projects
============================================

Below, you will find some example undergraduate dissertation projects that I have developed/supervised. These
projects are largely applying remote sensing to study different topics within geography or environmental sciences.

They are meant to be rather general - these are big topics, with many opportunities to develop additional ideas
within the scope of the project. This could include comparing different study areas, investigating different aspects of
mapping or detection (i.e., comparing different methods), or looking at changes over time.
