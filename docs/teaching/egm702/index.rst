This module covers advanced topics in optical remote sensing and image analysis, including (but not necessarily limited to):

- photogrammetry
- digital elevation models and terrain analysis
- image processing and manipulation
- advanced classification techniques such as object-based image analysis
- time series analysis and change detection using Google Earth Engine.

In this module, students will develop an in-depth understanding of advanced remote sensing data and methods. The module
will provide the necessary theoretical and practical knowledge of advanced principles of remote sensing, and will equip
students to use both proprietary and open-source software packages for advanced image analysis.

The module is structured to fit in six-week block, with instruction taking place in weeks 1-5 and week 6 left open for
project work.
