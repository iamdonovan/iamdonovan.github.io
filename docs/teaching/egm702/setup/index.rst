setup
======

We will be using at least two different software packages to complete the practicals: in Week 1, we will use
`MicMac <https://micmac.ensg.eu/index.php/Accueil>`__ for photogrammetric processing of historic aerial photographs.
The setup instructions for MicMac on Windows are provided below; please contact the instructor for help/instructions
setting up MicMac on other operating systems.

In Weeks 2-5, we will use either QGIS (`qgis.org <https://www.qgis.org/>`__) or ArcGIS Pro. The exercises for Weeks 2-5
are provided with instructions for either software package - you only need to choose one of them. You should already
have ArcGIS Pro installed after using it for EGM711; if you would like to try your hand at QGIS, follow the instructions
linked below.
