feature design and engineering
===============================

.. note::

    This is a **non-interactive** version of the exercise. If you want to run through the steps yourself and see the
    outputs, you'll need to do one of the following:

    - follow the setup steps and work through the notebook on your own computer
    - open the workshop materials on `binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/iamdonovan/ml-crash-course/HEAD>`__ and work
      through them online
