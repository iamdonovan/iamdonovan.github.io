setup
======

To work through the exercises, you'll need to install **git** and **conda** on your computer.

You will also need a **GitHub** account, and you'll need to **fork** and **clone** the
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/iamdonovan/ml-crash-course>`__ for the workshop.

Finally, you'll need to set up a **conda** environment so that you can install the packages that we will use
for the exercises.

For more detailed instructions on how to install **git** and **conda** (via **Anaconda Navigator**), along with forking
and cloning the repository, and setting up a **conda** environment, please see
:doc:`the setup instructions <../python-programming/setup/index>` from the **python workshop**. If you have already
participated in the intro to python workshop, most of these steps should already be done, or at least familiar to you.

Note that the repository link will be different, but all other aspects of the steps should be the same.
