======

To get started with the exercises, you'll need to install **git** and **conda** on your computer.

You will also need a **GitHub** account, and you'll need to fork and clone the
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/iamdonovan/ml-crash-course>`__ for the workshop.

Finally, you'll need to set up a **conda** environment so that you can install the packages that we will use
for the exercises.

For detailed instructions on how to install **git** and **conda** (via **Anaconda Navigator**), along with forking and
cloning the repository, and setting up a **conda** environment, please see the instructions in the **python workshop**.
Note that the repository link will be different, but all other aspects of the steps should be the same.
