web resources
-------------

- `Machine Learning Crash Course <https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course>`__ (Google). Google's
  machine learning crash course is another excellent resource you can use to learn more about the basics of machine
  learning. It uses `keras <https://keras.io/>`__ rather than scikit-learn, but the topics and content are
  otherwise similar.
