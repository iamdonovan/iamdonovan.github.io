setting up conda/anaconda
==========================

introduction
-------------

This page provides instructions for installing **conda**, an open-source package management system.
**conda** can be used from both the command-line as well as via a graphical user interface (GUI). We will primarily
be using the GUI provided by `Anaconda Navigator <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/>`_, part of the
AnacondaÂ® distribution, but we will occasionally make use of the command-line interface (CLI).

installing anaconda
--------------------

To begin, navigate to https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/, which contains detailed, operating-system dependent
instructions for installing Anaconda. Anaconda is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems; most of
the instructions for this course will be given using Windows, but I am happy to work with you on setting yourself up
in another operating system if need be. Follow the instructions for downloading and installing Anaconda using the link
above. When the installation is finished, move on to the next step, :doc:`environment`.
