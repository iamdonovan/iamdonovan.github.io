exercises
===========

To get started with the exercises, make sure that you've followed the :doc:`setup instructions<../setup/index>` - if you
haven't, you will have a difficult time getting started on the exercises.

.. note::

    The following pages contain instructions for getting started with each practical, including relevant steps
    using git/GitHub, as well as non-interactive overviews of the notebook.

    To actually run the practicals yourself, you'll need to go through the steps of cloning the github repository and
    setting up the environment outlined above, or follow the binder link to run the practicals online.
