setting up github
===================

The files for this module (practical workbooks, example scripts, and setup files) will all be shared via `GitHub <https://github.com/>`__,
**which means you will need to create an account if you do not already have one**. You can do so by clicking 'Sign up'
in the upper right corner of the GitHub homepage (https://github.com):

|br| Make sure that you do this before you move on to the next step, :doc:`installing git<git>`.
