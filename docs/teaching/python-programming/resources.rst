- `Scientific Computing with Python <https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/#python-for-everybody>`__:
  Another free online python course, this one has 56 lessons, including a number of example projects for you to test
  your knowledge.
- `learnpython.org <https://www.learnpython.org/>`__: This website has a number of tutorials that cover the basics of
  programming in python, plus some more advanced topics.
- `The Python standard library <https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/>`__: Links to the documentation for the python
  standard library, which provides a number of useful modules that are automatically provided with a python
  installation.
- `Programming with Python <https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/>`__: An online course
  introducing python.



git resources
--------------

- `Git Handbook <https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/>`__: A good, short introduction to git - what it
  is and why it's worth using.
- `Understand the GitHub flow <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/>`__: A short explainer on the basic workflow
  for git - how to use branches to more easily keep track of your projects.
- `GitHub Training & Guides <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7RrmoueENv9TZts3HXXtw>`__: YouTube channel for GitHub
  Training & Guides, which has a number of short-ish videos to help you get started with git and GitHub.

  practical experience with different git commands.
- `Github without the command line <https://coderefinery.github.io/github-without-command-line/>`__: CodeRefinery is a
  project within the `Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration <https://neic.no/>`__ that provides training courses and
  workshops in scientific programming and computing. This course provides a good introduction to using GitHub (and git)
  without the command line tools.
- `Oh My Git! <https://ohmygit.org/>`__: An open source game about learning git - similar to learn git branching above,
  but presented in a gameified format to help you learn + understand the commands and concepts surrounding git.


other resources
----------------

- `Software Carpentry <https://software-carpentry.org/>`__: An organization dedicated to teaching researchers computing
  skills needed for research. They have lots of good, free online resources, including a course in python linked above.
- `Data Carpentry <https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/>`__: An organization dedicated to teaching workshops that provide
  the fundamental data skills needed for research.
- `Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/>`__: The go-to resource for finding solutions to issues related to
  programming. If you have a question/issue, there's a good chance that someone else has already asked it, and gotten
  an answer. If not, you can post your question (be sure to check the posting guidelines!) to find help.
