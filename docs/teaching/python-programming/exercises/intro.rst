introduction to python using jupyterlab
========================================

.. note::

    This is a **non-interactive** version of the exercise. If you want to run through the steps yourself and see the
    outputs, you'll need to do one of the following:

    - follow the setup steps and work through the notebook on your own computer
    - open the workshop materials on `binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/iamdonovan/intro-to-python/>`__ and work
      through them online
    - open a python console, copy the lines of code here, and paste them into the console to run them
