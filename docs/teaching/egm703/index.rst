The aim of this module is to provide you with an in-depth understanding of active and passive remote sensing topics, including (but not limited to):

- thermal remote sensing
- hyperspectral remote sensing
- active and passive microwave remote sensing
- subsurface remote sensing

In this module, students will develop an in-depth understanding of advanced remote sensing data and methods. The module will provide the necessary theoretical and practical knowledge of advanced principles of remote sensing, and will equip students to use both proprietary and open-source software packages for advanced image analysis.
