practicals
==========

To get started with the exercises, make sure that you've followed the :doc:`setup instructions<../setup/index>` - if you
haven't, you will have a difficult time getting started on the exercises.

There is also a |binder| available, which will allow you to run the exercises remotely via your web browser. Note that
it may take some time to set up, particularly if it's been a while since anyone has used the link, but it should
eventually work.

.. note::

    The following linked pages contain instructions for getting started with each practical, as well as non-interactive
    overviews of the notebook.

    To actually run the practicals yourself, you'll need to go through the steps of cloning the github repository and
    setting up the environment outlined above, or follow the binder link to run the practicals online.
