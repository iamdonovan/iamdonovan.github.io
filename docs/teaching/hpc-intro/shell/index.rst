the unix shell
===============

In the first half of the workshop, we're going to introduce the **shell** - that is, a program that takes input
in the form of keyboard commands, and sends those commands to the operating system to actually run.

As with operating systems, languages, and ice cream, there are many different "flavors" of shell. We will be using
``bash`` (the Bourne Again SHell). This is the default shell installed on most Linux systems, including the two HPC
clusters used in the department (and, until Catalina, it was the default shell for MacOS).
