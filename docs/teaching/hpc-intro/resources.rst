- `LinuxCommand.org <https://linuxcommand.org/index.php>`__: A site with introductory information to the Linux Command
  line. This is the online version of the book by W. Shotts listed above.
- `The Unix Shell <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/index.html>`__: A good, detailed online introduction to
  using the Unix shell. The exercises shown here are modeled in part on this free course.
- `Introduction to High-Performance Computing <https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/hpc-intro/>`__: A good
  online introduction to high-performance computing, including sessions on the Unix shell and data transfer. Note that
  this is an alpha version of a workshop, so it is still in development.

other resources
----------------

- `Software Carpentry <https://software-carpentry.org/>`__: An organization dedicated to teaching researchers computing
  skills needed for research. They have lots of good, free online resources, including a course in python linked above.
- `Data Carpentry <https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/>`__: An organization dedicated to teaching workshops that provide
  the fundamental data skills needed for research.
- `Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/>`__: The go-to resource for finding solutions to issues related to
  computing and programming. If you have a question/issue, there's a good chance that someone else has already asked it,
  and gotten an answer. If not, you can post your question (be sure to check the posting guidelines!) to find help.
