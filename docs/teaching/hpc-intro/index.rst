introduction to high performance computing
===========================================

The purpose of this workshop is to provide a basic introduction to high-performance computing in two sessions. The first
session introduces the Unix shell, the basics of navigating and using the command line, and the use of shell scripts.

The second session introduces concepts behind high-performance computing, including how to submit jobs using two
different schedulers: `torque <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TORQUE>`__ (currently used on vulcan),
and `slurm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurm_Workload_Manager>`__ (currently used on atlas).

.. note::

    This workshop is meant to provide a quick "how-to" introduction to get you using the available HPC environments;
    it is manifestly **not** meant to provide in-depth coverage of topics such as parallel computing or programming
    more generally.

    If you are interested in those topics, please feel free to browse some of the other sections that you can see to
    the left-hand side of your screen. :)
